      <description>I was teamed up to play hxp CTF as @blackb6a last week. The hxp team had come up with a collection of hard challenges. In particular, there are two series of crypto challenges with a total of five parts. I will be writing on the hyper challenge and some follow-up and unanswered questions regarding to hyperelliptic curves.

Seriously. I knew nothing on hyperelliptic curves prior to the CTF.</description>

      <description>Written from the perspective of Mystiz. babykok writeup by GeoffreyY.   .alert { padding: 20px; color: white; margin-bottom: 15px; } .alert.success { background-color: #28a745; } .alert.info { background-color: #17a2b8; } .alert.warning { background-color: #ffc107; color: #212529; } .alert.danger { background-color: #dc3545; }  Dragon CTF 2020 is definitely had my best CTF moments. There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a.</description>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>

      <title>De1CTF 2019 Writeup</title>

      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
Babylfsr (Crypto, 338 points) This is an easy challenge.</description>
