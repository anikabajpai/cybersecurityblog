      <description>I was teamed up to play hxp CTF as @blackb6a last week. The hxp team had come up with a collection of hard challenges. In particular, there are two series of crypto challenges with a total of five parts. I will be writing on the hyper challenge and some follow-up and unanswered questions regarding to hyperelliptic curves.
ⓘ 𝗢𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴
Seriously. I knew nothing on hyperelliptic curves prior to the CTF.</description>

      <description>Written from the perspective of Mystiz. babykok writeup by GeoffreyY.   .alert { padding: 20px; color: white; margin-bottom: 15px; } .alert.success { background-color: #28a745; } .alert.info { background-color: #17a2b8; } .alert.warning { background-color: #ffc107; color: #212529; } .alert.danger { background-color: #dc3545; }  Dragon CTF 2020 is definitely had my best CTF moments. There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a.</description>

      <description>This writeup is compiled by @blackb6a: cire meat pop (@Khlung1), harrier (@harrier_lcc), Ozetta (@02E774) and Mystiz (@mystiz613).
urlcheck v1 (Web, 98 points) Solved by Ozetta.
Objective: SSRF http://127.0.0.1/admin-status The input needs to fulfil the pattern &#39;\A(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)\Z&#39; and the first octet cannot be 0 or 127, and some other patterns for internal IP addresses. For some reason, int(&amp;quot;0177&amp;quot;) is still 177 instead of 127 in Python, so we can use http://0177.0.0.1/admin-status</description>

      <description>Rotten Secured Algorithm is the only challenge that I have written for Firebird Intro CTF. Two people (out of 166) ended up solving the challenge.
There is a Python script attached in the challenge, as well as the output file. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on in the Python:

      <description>This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF. We end up ranked 15, but we are more proud of ourselves able to solve a reversing challenge called Team Trees (395 points, 5 solves).
In particular, we are the first-to-solve to the challenge. It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.
Challenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it&#39;s going kinda slow.</description>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>

      <description>Challenge Summary  Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?
 nookcrypt is a netcat service that have no source code released. There are two functions exposed:
 Gets an encrypted copy of the flag (and the message hello world). Encrypts an arbitrary message.  For example, this is what I had when trying out the options:</description>

      <description>I was teamed up with @shellphish this time for De1CTF. During the game, I have solved 5 (out of 7) cryptography challenges individually, and a reverse challenge and a misc challenge in cooperation with DuSu and fs0c.
I said that I&#39;ll commit the solution scripts to my Github after I have managed to prettify them. It never happened. I will not make the same promise again.
Homomorphic Challenge Summary This is a cryptography challenge with 465 points.</description>

      <description>This challenge is solved with R3x and @mahal0z as a part of @shellphish. Thanks @piazzt and @perribus for reviewing and giving me suggestions on this write-up.
Challenge Summary A Plaid Puzzle is a RPG game written in PuzzleScript. In the game, you are able to control as the player and you could move around and mess with a string. The game is available online on PuzzleScript.net. Below is a screenshot of the game:</description>

      <description>This writeup is compiled on behalf as @blackb6a. In particular the writeup for &amp;quot;Avec?&amp;quot; is written by @harrier_lcc.
Pass the Hash (Warmup/Learning; 50 points) Challenge Summary We are given a peculiar hash algorithm that generates 64-byte long hashes, which wraps of sha0, sha1, sha256 and ripemd160. The hash takes two arguments, salt (20 bytes) and password (22 bytes). We are allowed to control the salt, whilst the goal is to find the password within 1024 queries.</description>

      <guid>/posts/2019-08-06-de1ctf/</guid>
      <description>It has been a very long time that I&#39;ve compiled a writeup. This time I have played on my own as @blackb6a. Let me write on some particular interesting ideas that I have learnt in the challenges. Bear with me if you find this writeup too math-intensive.
The solution scripts will be committed to my Github repository sooner or later, after I&#39;ve managed to prettify them.
Babylfsr (Crypto, 338 points) This is an easy challenge.</description>
