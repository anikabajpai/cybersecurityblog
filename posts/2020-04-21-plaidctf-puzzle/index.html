<p>A Plaid Puzzle is a RPG game written in <em>PuzzleScript</em>. In the game, you are able to control as the player and you could move around and mess with a string. The game is available online on <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=a7e867c17405726eb0962b6483f51e4b">PuzzleScript.net</a>. Below is a screenshot of the game:</p>

<p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T7qVs4r.png" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>Wait, where is the player? Although it is invisible, you can easily spot him out as he is always surrounded by the blue arrows.</p>

<p>Moreover, the source code of the game is available over there. After all, we are able to deal with it in white-box.</p>

<p>This is what we can see in the source code:</p>

<p>We will get into the details in the story.</p>

<h3 id="part-i-making-sense-of-the-source-code">Part I: Making sense of the source code<a href="#part-i-making-sense-of-the-source-code" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<p>What is this gibberish thingy above? It looks obfuscated, and those weird symbols at the end of the script looks fishy.</p>

<p>I was late to the party. I didn't try to understand the source code from the documentation, but instead messing around with the source code. There is the line that caught my attention:</p>
<pre><code>[ fljldviokmmfmqzd | iawjsmjfczakueqy ] -&gt; [ fljldviokmmfmqzd | ] message Good flag!
[ ywmxqezdfjsufycd | iawjsmjfczakueqy ] -&gt; [ ywmxqezdfjsufycd | ] message Bad flag!</code></pre>
<p>Luckily @R3x and @mahaloz had already done enough to simplify the script. They have come up with a summary that helped a lot:</p>
<pre><code>each variable is a space

[ ] have a condition
[ v1 | v2 ] =&gt; v1 next to v2
[ v1 v2 ] =&gt; v1 on top of v2
-&gt; represents the action to be performed
[ if ] -&gt; [ then ]
both if and then need to have same amount of spaces 
[ v1 | v2 ] -&gt; [ v1 | ] =&gt; destroy v2 when v1 next to v2
[ v1 v2 ] -&gt; [ v1 ] =&gt; doesn’t destroy v2 since they are on top
[ &gt; v1 | v2 ] -&gt; [ v2 | v1 ] =&gt; swap is next to
[ v1 v2] [ v3 v4 ] -&gt; [ ] [ ] =&gt; multiple conditions 
left [v1 | v2] -&gt; [v1 | ] =&gt; delete v2 if v1 is left of v2
again =&gt; execute these instructions once again after an instruction
Action =&gt; keyword activates when we press X

* if we define v = v1 or v2 or v3 =&gt; [x1 | v] contains applies on all 
* Objects on the same collision layer can&#39;t be on top of each other
* Legend contains the initial positions of each of the &#34;variables&#34;
* again commands execute only if there was some modification before
* if we need to apply action to multiple objects we use action on both sides
* better to call each variable an object
* Rules apply repeatedly until they no longer can be applied. (Therefore there is no execution order)</code></pre>
<p>If the character <code>fljldviokmmfmqzd</code> is standing next to <code>iawjsmjfczakueqy</code>, <code>iawjsmjfczakueqy</code> will be eliminated and we are informed having the correct flag.
On a contrast, it would be bad if <code>ywmxqezdfjsufycd</code> is next to <code>iawjsmjfczakueqy</code>.</p>

<p>In this stage, we have four main characters in this RPG game: <code>fljldviokmmfmqzd</code> (the <em>yes</em>), <code>ywmxqezdfjsufycd</code> (the <em>no</em>), <code>iawjsmjfczakueqy</code> (the <em>terminator</em>) and me. I searched for the occurrence of those characters. These are the points I summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are able to find a bunch of lines in the below format.</p>
<pre><code>[ fljldviokmmfmqzd | tgykpmrvaltbuokz ] -&gt; [ ywmxqezdfjsufycd | ] again
  yes ************                           no *************
# Found 63 times
      
[ ywmxqezdfjsufycd | kalmsmalpgkzhrpv ] -&gt; [ ywmxqezdfjsufycd | ] again
  no *************                           no *************
# Found 64 times
    
[ fljldviokmmfmqzd | kkavwvmbabfuqctz ] -&gt; [ fljldviokmmfmqzd | ] again
  yes ************                           yes ************
# Found 1 time</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, those are exactly the lines right above the lines giving the verdict.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that there is an area drawing the characters.</p>
<pre><code>fljldviokmmfmqzd
transparent
    
ywmxqezdfjsufycd
transparent
    
iawjsmjfczakueqy

<p>I think it is inhumane to make our main characters transparent. Let's make them visible again!</p>

<p>This is how it looks when I begin to check the flag. It was changed into red after a while - and we are told having the wrong input after a moment.</p>

<p>But there is one more thing: <code>kkavwvmbabfuqctz</code> is the only character that makes the green icon intact. We are labelling it as well!</p>

<p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bhz1AOG.gif" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>We see that yellow stars are randomly blinking now.</p>

<p>At this moment, @R3x has made the source code more readable by replacing the character names into something less random (bye, <code>fljldviokmmfmqzd</code>!).</p>

<p>After having a basic insight on what we have right now, let's read the code line by line. Better not - there are around 10k lines to read and it doesn't sound fun at all! It is better for us to grasp the idea on what's going on.</p>

<p>I would surely not define myself as a reverser. I was so tempted to consider the whole game as a black-box. At some time I tried to send <code>PCTF{AAAA...AAA}</code> - There is a larger delay for the green character to become red! We were excited and would try a timing attack.</p>

<p>Turns out it isn't the right way to go. If I have to reason why this happened, I would think the clock was a bit unstable, causing such an illusion.</p>

<p>We have been playing around with the source code since then. The first advancement happens when we make two changes to the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"><span style="color:#f92672">- zoomscreen 47x3
</span><span style="color:#f92672"></span><span style="color:#a6e22e">+ zoomscreen 47x50
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Changing all the occurrence of <code>transparent</code> into <code>gray</code> - liberate all the characters!</p>

<p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ybRpM0U.gif" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>It was so satisfying that I have watched the animation for more than 10 times during the CTF.</p>

<p>In the source code, there are three type of rules which seems important:</p>
<pre><code>[ val_135 | x_56 ] -&gt; [ val_50 | x_56 ] again
# 4096 instructions - &#34;conversion&#34;

right [ val_125 | val_70 ] -&gt; [ val_111 | ] again
# 4096 instructions - &#34;elimination&#34;

[ v_no | val_180 ] -&gt; [ v_no | ] again
# 128 instructions - &#34;final&#34;</code></pre>
<p>There is a bunch of final instructions that converts <code>v_yes</code> (the green character a.k.a. <code>fljldviokmmfmqzd</code>) into <code>v_no</code>. Why don't we label them red, indicating that they are bad?</p>

<p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GiGW0ew.gif" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>Woah. So they are all initially on the rightmost of the board. We tried a bunch of things: encode them into runes, classify the characters into classes... and we end up with this amazing thingy:</p>

<p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/avbDSfG.gif" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>We have to explain how can we classify characters into groups. Recalled from two minutes ago that we have three types of rules:</p>
<pre><code>[ a_i | x_k ] -&gt; [ c_j | x_k ] again
# 4096 instructions - &#34;conversion&#34;

right [ c_k | b_i ] -&gt; [ b_j | ] again
# 4096 instructions - &#34;elimination&#34;

[ v_no | b_i ] -&gt; [ v_no | ] again
# 128 instructions - &#34;final&#34;</code></pre>
<p>Mathematically, we have $A$, $B$ and $C$ being three classes of characters. In particular, $b_0\in B$ is the only element that keeps <code>v_yes</code> intact.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>[Conversion]</strong> When $a_i\in A$ meets an input character, it will be replaced into some $c_j\in C$.</li>
<li><strong>[Elimination]</strong> When $b_i\in B$ meets $c_k\in C$, $c_k$ will be eliminated. And $b_i$ will be replaced to some $b_j\in B$.</li>
<li><strong>[Final]</strong> When $b_i\in B$ meets <code>v_yes</code> or <code>v_no</code>, it will be consumed. <code>v_yes</code> will remain unchanged only if the $b = b_0$.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've labelled $A$ in brown, $B$ in red (except $b_0$ which is in green) and $C$ in blue.</p>

<p>It looks like $b\in B$ would consume an entire row of $c$'s while it moves to the left. That makes me thinking: is it equivalent to a system of linear equations?</p>

<div class="alert warning">
  <strong>Why?</strong> I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I think there must be a relationship between $b$ and $c$. Otherwise, we will be unable to find an efficient algorithm to solve for the flag.

<p>I have just assumed that it is a linear system. But how can it be related? To begin, reimagine what actually are <em>conversion</em>, <em>elimination</em> and <em>final</em>. Here comes a linear system:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
\begin{cases}\begin{matrix}
a_{11}x_1 &+& a_{12}x_2 &+& ... &+& a_{1n}x_n &=& b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 &+& a_{22}x_2 &+& ... &+& a_{2n}x_n &=& b_2 \\
&&&& \vdots &&&& \\
a_{n1}x_1 &+& a_{n2}x_2 &+& ... &+& a_{nn}x_n &=& b_n
\end{matrix}\end{cases}
\]</span></p>

<p>Take a look on the map below. Is there a similarity?</p>

<p>The brown runes are $a_{ij}$'s, the red (or green) ones are $b_i$'s in the linear system. The blue runes are evident now: they represents $a_{ij}x_j$'s. Therefore,</p>

<ol>
<li>the <em>conversion</em> property (that changes brown runes into blue when it meets a character) is a <strong>multiplication</strong>,</li>
<li>the <em>elimination</em> property is a <strong>summation</strong>,</li>
<li>the <em>final</em> property is to <strong>verify</strong> if the summation equals $b_0$.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can now convert those instructions into math:</p>
<pre><code>[ a_i | x_k ] -&gt; [ c_j | x_k ] again
# a_i * x_k = c_j

right [ c_k | b_i ] -&gt; [ b_j | ] again
# b_i + c_k = b_j

[ v_yes | b_0 ] -&gt; [ v_yes | ] again
# assume that the summation equals 0</code></pre>
<hr>

<p>How do I know if my guess is correct?</p>

<p>I was first looking for the <em>elimination</em> (or <em>summation</em>) instruction. To be exact, I want to find invariants:</p>
<pre><code>right [ c_k | b_i ] -&gt; [ b_i | ] again
#             ***        *** those are equal              </code></pre>
<p>It is made possible by the regex <code>right \[ c\d+ \| b(\d+) \] -&gt; \[ b\1 \| \]</code> again.</p>

<p>There are 64 matches. Here are some of the results:</p>
<pre><code>right [ c44 | b7  ] -&gt; [ b7  | ] again # c44 + b7  = b7
right [ c44 | b21 ] -&gt; [ b21 | ] again # c44 + b21 = b21
right [ c44 | b8  ] -&gt; [ b8  | ] again # c44 + b8  = b8
right [ c44 | b31 ] -&gt; [ b31 | ] again # c44 + b31 = b31
...</code></pre>
<p><code>c44</code> appears in all of the matches! If $c_{44} + b_i = b_i$ for all $i$, we can imply that $c_{44} = 0$.</p>

<p>With this piece of fact, we can find the <code>i</code>'s and <code>j</code>'s with <code>a_i * x_j = c_44 = 0</code>. There are 127 matches, including:</p>
<pre><code>[ a46 | x23 ] -&gt; [ c44 | x23 ] again # a46 * x23 = c44
[ a46 | x63 ] -&gt; [ c44 | x63 ] again # a46 * x63 = c44
[ a46 | x48 ] -&gt; [ c44 | x48 ] again # a46 * x48 = c44
[ a40 | x36 ] -&gt; [ c44 | x36 ] again # a40 * x36 = c44
[ a4  | x36 ] -&gt; [ c44 | x36 ] again # x4  * x36 = c44
...</code></pre>
<p>From the matches, I can see that <code>a_i * x_j = c_44 = 0</code> if and only if <code>i = 46</code> or <code>j = 36</code>.</p>

<p>As there are 64 distinct elements, I could think of two possibilities: Either it is taken under modulo 64, or it is operated under $\text{GF}(2^6)$ (the finite field of 64 elements).</p>

<p>However, it is definitely not under modulo 64. The multiplication property shows $ax = 0$ happens if and only if either $a=0\ \text{or}\ x=0$.
This is not the case for operations under modulo 64. There are non-trivial solutions (where $a$ and $x$ are both non-zero): When $a=32$ and $x=4$, $ax = 32\times 4 = 128 \equiv 0\ (\text{mod}\ 64)$.</p>

<p>Eliminating the possibility being modulo 64 operated, we are assuming that the linear system is taken under $\text{GF}(2^6)$.</p>

  <strong>What if $\text{GF}(2^6)$ doesn&rsquo;t check out as well?</strong> Well&hellip; that means my instinct is incorrect. This whole part is then redundant and meaningless.

<p>We can safely assume that $b_0 = 0$. We have already deduced that $a_{46} = x_{36} = c_{44} = 0$ as well. Knowing all the pairs of $(i, j, k)$ with $a_ix_j = c_k$ and $b_i + c_k = b_j$, we can find a mapping between $A, B, C, X$ and $\text{GF}(2^6)$.</p>

<p>Note that $g$ is a generator element for $\text{GF}(2^6)\setminus{0}$ and can be any element from the set. We can write $\text{GF}(2^6) = {0, 1, g, g^2, ..., g^{62}}$.</p>

<div class="alert warning">
  <strong>How?</strong> We can assume that $a_p = 1$, $a_q = g$ and $x_r = 1$. This would allow us to find every single element of $A, B, C$ and $X$. We can find a correct solution by brute-forcing $p, q, r$ (there are less than $2^{18}$ combinations), and more importantly, there are multiple (a lot of) correct answers.
